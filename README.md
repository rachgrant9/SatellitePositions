# SatellitePositions
This was a fun learning project for me as I had to brush up on my Python and remind myself how to do a TDD style project using pytest.
I started with the load_positions utility method and set up the test for this function afterwards to ensure I had my project set up correctly.
After that I followed a TDD style approach for the other methods.

## Theory


## Repo Structure
I decided to follow a basic repo structure with a src folder containing my src functions, and a test class with tests for each function.
I stored the code_test_data.csv file in a data folder within the repo. 

## Improvements that should be made to the code

### SOLID Principles

### Testing

### Deployment
